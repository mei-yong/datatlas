##### Datatlas Release Notes #####

1.0.0 @ 2019-09-23
* Function that takes a df input and outputs a df with a basic data profile & warnings.

Note: wherever I miss out versions, it's probably because I messed up the Git or Python package distribution (I'll never understand wheels and eggs haha - if you get them, please teach me)
