##### Datatlas Release Notes #####

1.0.3 @ 2019-10-31
* Added functionality that predicts missing numerical data values using SGDRegressor - as an alternative to replacing missing values with a mean/max/etc

1.0.1 @ 2019-10-26
* Added more detailed dtype profiling using regex
* Refactored some of the code to make it more modular & easier for future working

1.0.0 @ 2019-09-23
* Function that takes a df input and outputs a df with a basic data profile & warnings

Note: wherever I miss out versions, it's probably because I messed up the Git or Python package distribution (I'll never understand wheels and eggs haha - if you get them, please teach me)
